# Rust MySQL Web 💻 Example

A simple Rust application that uses SQLx to interact with a MySQL database.

More specifically, it manages a database of Stardew Valley characters (for the sake of an example). Each character has a name, a birthday, a favourite gift item and whether or not they're available for marriage.

This is a Rust backend for displaying information in a web frontend.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Rust and MySQL installed on your machine.

1. [Install Rust.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. [Install MySQL.](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html)

3. Copy the already existing `.env.example` file in the root folder and rename it to `.env`. Change the credentials in the first line to be the ones that you have previously set up in your MySQL environment.

4. Run the setup script to create the database:
    ```console
    cargo run --bin setup_db
    ```

    Alternatively, you can create a database manually and just fill in the proper values in the `.env` file.

5. Finally, you can run the main application:
    ```console
    cargo run --bin main
    ```
